# Machine Learning
This is a machine learning library developed by Enzo Mendez for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.

Based on the car_decision_tree implementation, you can call ID3_entropy, ID3_majority_error, or ID3_gini_index to construct decision trees that will learn from a dataset. The parameters for these methods are the same: data, features, and depth. The data parameter represents the pandas dataframe used as the current subset. When the method is first called, 'data' takes in the complete dataset and with each recursive call, it takes only a subset of the previous dataset. The features parameter represents a pandas dataframe with all the current available features. When the method is first called, 'features' takes in the original dataset minus the label column and with each recursive call, it takes only a subset of the previous features set. The depth parameter represents the maximum depth of the tree and it is used to limit the size of the tree. With each recursive call, the depth decreases by one, and the tree will either stop when it reaches that depth or it will grow to the maximum possible level if the depth is not yet reached.
