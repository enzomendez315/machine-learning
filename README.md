# Machine Learning
This is a machine learning library developed by Enzo Mendez for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.

The way to create a new tree is by instantiating the DecisionTree class and calling ID3, which is a method that contains 3 parameters: dataset, features, and depth. The dataset parameter should be a pandas dataframe containing all of the features and the training labels. The features parameter represents a dictionary containing the features as keys and its respective values (like 'Sunny', 'Overcast', 'Rainy' for the Outlook feature) as their value pair. When the method is first called, 'features' contains all the available features and with each recursive call, it takes only a subset of the previous features set. The depth parameter represents the maximum depth of the tree and it is used to limit the size of the tree. With each recursive call, the depth decreases by one, and the tree will either stop when it reaches that depth or it will grow to the maximum possible level if the depth is not yet reached.
